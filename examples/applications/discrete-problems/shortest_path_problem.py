# In this example, the graph is represented as a NumPy array where each element represents the cost or distance between two nodes.
#
# Note that this implementation assumes that the graph is represented by a symmetric matrix, where graph[i,j] represents
# the distance between nodes i and j. If your graph representation is different, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
#
# Please keep in mind that this implementation is a basic example and may not be optimized for large-scale problems.
# Further modifications and optimizations may be required depending on your specific use case.
