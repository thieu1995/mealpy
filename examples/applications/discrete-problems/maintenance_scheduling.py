# In maintenance scheduling, the goal is to optimize the schedule for performing maintenance tasks on
# various assets or equipment. The objective is to minimize downtime and maximize the utilization of
# assets while considering various constraints such as resource availability, task dependencies,
# and time constraints.

# Each element in the solution represents whether a task is assigned to an asset (1) or not (0).
# The schedule specifies when each task should start and which asset it is assigned to,
# aiming to minimize the total downtime.
#
# By using the Mealpy, you can find an efficient maintenance schedule that minimizes downtime,
# maximizes asset utilization, and satisfies various constraints,
# ultimately optimizing the maintenance operations for improved reliability and productivity.
