# Production optimization, also known as production planning, is the process of determining the most efficient and effective way to produce goods
# or services in a manufacturing or production environment. It involves making strategic decisions to allocate resources, schedule production
# activities, and optimize various factors to achieve the desired production goals.

# The objective of production optimization is to find the optimal production plan that maximizes production output, minimizes production costs,
# and ensures efficient utilization of resources while meeting customer demand and other relevant constraints. The production plan typically
# includes decisions related to production quantities, production schedules, resource allocation, inventory management, and more.

# The production optimization process typically involves the following steps:
#   1. Demand Forecasting: Estimating the future demand for the products or services to be produced. This forecast provides a
#       basis for planning production quantities and schedules.
#   2. Capacity Planning: Assessing the available production capacity and determining if it is sufficient to meet the forecasted demand.
#       Capacity planning involves evaluating current resources, such as machinery, labor, and facilities, and making decisions on
#       resource allocation and potential expansion or contraction.
#   3. Production Scheduling: Creating a detailed schedule that specifies when and how each production task or operation will
#       be executed. This includes determining the order of production, the allocation of resources to specific tasks, and the
#       sequencing of activities to optimize efficiency.
#   4. Inventory Management: Determining the optimal levels of raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), and finished goods inventory
#       to ensure smooth production flow, minimize stockouts, and control inventory holding costs.
#   5. Resource Allocation: Assigning resources such as labor, equipment, and materials to different production tasks or processes
#       in the most efficient manner. This involves considering factors such as resource availability, skill requirements,
#       and minimizing idle time or bottlenecks.
#   6. Performance Monitoring and Optimization: Continuously monitoring the production process and performance metrics to
#       identify areas for improvement and make adjustments to the production plan. This may involve analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs)
#       like production output, cycle time, lead time, quality, and cost to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or opportunities for optimization.

# By optimizing the production plan, businesses can improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, enhance customer satisfaction through
# timely delivery, and gain a competitive advantage in the market. It's worth noting that production optimization can vary significantly
# depending on the specific industry, production processes, and objectives of the organization. Different industries may have unique
# considerations, such as perishable goods, complex supply chains, or regulatory requirements, which need to be incorporated into the
# production planning process. Overall, production optimization aims to strike a balance between maximizing production output, minimizing costs,
# and meeting customer demands, while considering various constraints and factors specific to the production environment.


#============================================== EXAMPLE ========================================================

# Let's consider a simplified example of production optimization in the context of a manufacturing company that produces electronic devices,
# such as smartphones. The objective is to maximize production output while minimizing production costs.

#   1. Demand Forecasting: The company analyzes market trends, historical sales data, and other relevant factors to forecast the demand for
#       smartphones. Based on this forecast, they estimate that the demand for the upcoming quarter will be 10,000 smartphones.
#   2. Capacity Planning: The company evaluates its production capacity, including factors such as available machinery, labor resources,
#       and production floor space. They determine that their current capacity allows them to produce up to 12,000 smartphones per quarter.
#   3. Production Scheduling: The production team creates a detailed schedule that specifies the production quantities and sequences.
#       They decide to divide the production into two batches: one batch of 8,000 smartphones in the first half of the quarter and another
#       batch of 4,000 smartphones in the second half. This scheduling decision is based on optimizing the utilization of resources and minimizing setup times.
# 4. Inventory Management: The company maintains an inventory of raw materials and components required for smartphone production. They monitor
#       the inventory levels and ensure that they have sufficient materials to meet the production schedule without excessive stockouts or
#       excess inventory. By optimizing inventory management, they minimize holding costs while ensuring uninterrupted production.
# 5. Resource Allocation: The production team assigns the available labor and machinery to the production tasks based on their capabilities
#       and requirements. They optimize the allocation of resources to balance the workload and minimize idle time. This may involve cross-training
#       employees to handle multiple tasks and optimizing the utilization of machinery to avoid bottlenecks.
# 6. Performance Monitoring and Optimization: Throughout the production process, the company closely monitors key performance indicators
#       (KPIs) such as production output, cycle time, defect rate, and production costs. They identify areas of improvement, such as optimizing
#       production line layouts, streamlining assembly processes, or implementing quality control measures. By continuously monitoring and
#       optimizing performance, they strive to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

# By following these steps and continuously optimizing their production plan, the company can maximize their smartphone production output
# while minimizing production costs. This, in turn, helps them meet customer demand, reduce time-to-market, and enhance their competitiveness in the market.
# It's important to note that this example is simplified for illustrative purposes.

# This example uses binary representations for production configurations, assuming each task can be assigned to a resource (1) or not (0).
# You may need to adapt the representation and operators to suit your specific production optimization problem.
