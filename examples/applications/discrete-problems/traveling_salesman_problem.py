# In the context of the Mealpy for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a solution is a possible route that
# represents a tour of visiting all the cities exactly once and returning to the starting city. The solution is typically
# represented as a permutation of the cities, where each city appears exactly once in the permutation.

# For example, let's consider a TSP instance with 5 cities labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. A possible solution could be
# represented as the permutation [A, B, D, E, C], which indicates the order in which the cities are visited. This solution
# suggests that the tour starts at city A, then moves to city B, then D, E, and finally C before returning to city A.
