## The goal is to create an optimal schedule that assigns employees to shifts while satisfying various constraints and objectives.
# Note that this implementation assumes that the shift requirements and costs are provided as numpy arrays. The
#   shift_requirements array has dimensions (num_employees, num_shifts), and shift_costs is a 1D array of length num_shifts.
# Please keep in mind that this is a simplified implementation, and you may need to modify it according to the
#   specific requirements and constraints of your employee rostering problem.
# Additionally, you might want to introduce additional mechanisms or constraints such as fairness, employee
#   preferences, or shift dependencies to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.


# For example, if you have 5 employees and 3 shifts, a chromosome could be represented as [2, 1, 0, 2, 0],
# where employee 0 is assigned to shift 2, employee 1 is assigned to shift 1, employee 2 is assigned to shift 0, and so on.
