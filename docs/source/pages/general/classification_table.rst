* Meta-heuristic Algorithm's Categories: (Based on `this article`_)
    + Evolutionary-based: inspired by Darwin's law of natural selection, evolutionary computing
    + Swarm-based: inspired by movement, interaction, and organization of birds, social insects, and other animals
    + Physics-based: inspired by physical laws such as Newton's law of universal gravitation, black holes, and multiverse
    + Human-based: inspired by human interaction, such as queuing search, teaching-learning, and cultural algorithms
    + Biology-based: inspired by biological creatures or microorganisms, such as genetic algorithms and artificial immune systems
    + System-based: inspired by ecosystem, immune system, and network system.
    + Math-based: inspired by mathematical forms or laws, such as sin-cosin functions, golden ratio.
    + Music-based: inspired by music instruments, such as harmony search

* Difficulty - Difficulty Level (Personal Opinion): Objective observation from author. Depend on the number of parameters, number of equations, the original ideas, time spend for coding, source lines of code (SLOC).
    + Easy: Few parameters, few equations, and very short SLOC (Source lines of code)
    + Medium: More equations than the Easy level, longer SLOC than the Easy level
    + Hard: Lots of equations, longer SLOC than the Medium level, and the paper is difficult to read.
    + Hard* - Very hard:Lots of equations, SLOC is too long, and the paper is very difficult to read.

**For newbies, it is recommended to start by reading papers on algorithms that are categorized as "easy" or "medium" difficulty level.**
