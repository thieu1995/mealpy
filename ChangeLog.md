        + Paper: An improved Jaya optimization algorithm with Levy flight
        + Link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113902
        + Notes:
            + This version I still remove all third loop in algorithm
            + The beta value of Levy-flight equal to 1.8 as the best value in the paper.

+ DE, its state-of-the-art variants.
    + DESAP: including DESAP-Abs and DESAP-Rel
        + The main ideas is identified the population size without user-defined. Proposed equation: 
            + Initial ps_init = 10*n (n: is the problem size, number of dimensions)
            + DESAP-Abs: ps = round(ps_init + N (0, 1)), (N: is Gaussian value)

        + The paper is very different than the author's matlab code. Even the algorithm's flow is wrong with index i, j.

        crossover process of Genetic Algorithm to his algorithm in the code (but not even mention it in the paper) to
         get the results in the paper. Don't know what to say about this.

    + OriginalFOA:
        + This algorithm is the weakest algorithm in MHAs. It can't run with complicated objective function.
    + BaseFOA:
        + I changed the fitness function (smell function) by taking the distance each 2 adjacent dimensions
         --> Number of variables reduce from N to N-1
        + Update the position if only it find the better fitness value.
    + WFOA:
        + The original version of Whale Fruit-fly Optimization Algorithm (WFOA)
        + Paper: Boosted Hunting-based Fruit Fly Optimization and Advances in Real-world Problems
        + From my point of view, this algorithm is almost the same as Whale, only different in calculate fitness
         function. So it is not surprise that It outperforms BaseFOA

+ Added Spotted Hyena Optimizer (SHO) to swarm_based group:
    + OriginalSHO: my modified version

       
+ Add category for questionable algorithm or papers (called fake): 
    + Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) to swarm_based group:
        + OriginalBOA: this algorithm is made up one 
        + AdaptiveBOA:
        + BaseBOA:
            + Look at the author of this algorithm
            + https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=KvcHovcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate
            + It is interesting to note that there have been many variant versions of BOA created since 2015, even though the inventor of BOA only published it in 2019. This raises some questions about the origins of these variant algorithms and how they came to be.
             
    + Sandpiper Optimization Algorithm (SOA) to swarm_based group:
        + OriginalSOA: the original version is made up one
            + This algorithm suffers from local optimal and lower convergence rate. 
            + It cannot update the position, so how to converge without update position?
            + I am curious about the algorithm's publication history, as I have found it submitted to multiple journals.
            + A detailed explain in this comment section 
            (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334897831_Sandpiper_optimization_algorithm_a_novel_approach_for_solving_real-life_engineering_problems/comments)
        + BaseSOA: my modified version which changed some equations and flow.
        
    + Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA) is another name of Sandpiper Optimization Algorithm (SOA) 
        + If you read the paper, you will see the similarity between these two 
    
    + Blue Monkey Optimization (BMO) to swarm_based group:
        + OriginalBMO: 
            + It is a made-up algorithm with a similar idea to "Chicken Swarm Optimization," which raises questions about its originality.
            + The pseudo-code is confusing, particularly the "Rate equation," which starts as a random number and then becomes a vector after the first loop. 
            + The movement of the blue monkey and children is the same equations???
            + The algorithm does not check the bound after updating the position, which can cause issues with the search space.
            + The algorithm does not provide guidance on how to find the global best from the blue monkey group or child group.
        + BaseBMO: my modified version which used my knowledge about meta-heuristics to do it.

# Version 1.0.0

### Change models
+ Change root model, then all of the algorithms are now change
    + domain_range -> lower bound and upper bound
    + log -> verbose
    + objective_func -> obj_func
    + batch-size training -> Inspired by the idea of batch-size training in gradient descent algorithm
+ Idea of batch-size training in meta-heuristics
    + Some algorithms update the global best solution when all of the individuals in the population have moved to a new position.
        + This idea is a similarity to the training the whole dataset in GD
    + But some algorithms update after each move to a new position.
        + This idea is a similarity as SGD
    + But the point here is if the algorithm doesn't take advantage of the global best solution when updating individual 
    the position then GD or SGD gives the same results.
    
    + So my idea of batch-size training here is very simple, after batch-size of individuals move, then we will update
    the global best solution. So:
        + batch-size = 1 ==> SGD
        + batch-size = population-size ==> GD 
        + batch-size should set = 10% / 25% / 50% of your population size
    
    + Some algorithms can't apply the idea of batch-size. For examples:
        + If the original algorithm has already divided the population into m-clan (m-group) --> No need batch-size here
        + If the original algorithm contains multiple-part. Each part contains several types of updating --> No need too.
        
+ For music_based:
    + BaseHS (HS): Is the one can't use batch-size idea, but not belong to any reason above.

+ For math_based:
    + BaseSCA (SCA): Updated with batch-size idea. Keep the original version for reference.

                  using the wheel and select a single position and update based on its all variable of that position.
    + BaseVCS (VCS):
        + Remove all third loop, make algorithm n-times faster than original

        + Using k-way tournament selection to select parent instead of randomizing
        + Repeat cross-over population_size / 2 instead of n_var/2
        + Mutation 50% of position instead of swap only 2 variable in a single position
        + OriginalBWO: is made up algorithm and just a variant of Genetic Algorithm
    + BaseAAA (AAA): This is my changed version but still not working
        + OriginalAAA: is made up algorithm taken from DE and CRO 
        + I realize in the original paper, parameters, and equations not clear.
        + In the Adaptation phase, what is the point of saving starving value when it doesn't affect the solution at all?
        + The size of the solution always = 2/3, so the friction surface will always stay at the same value.
        + The idea of the equation seems like taken from DE, the adaptation and reproduction process seem like taken from CRO.
        + Appearance from 2015, but still now 2020 none of Matlab code or python code about this algorithm.
    + EOA:
